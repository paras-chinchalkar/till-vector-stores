The poem ends by highlighting Sachin Tendulkar, a legendary player fondly labelled as \"the God of Cricket\", and the influence of the IPL in modernizing the sport.  Further, it adds a fun fact - time flies in cricket - referring to a record-breaking match lasting over a full 10 days. \n","\n","\n","Here is the quote for the quiz you requested.\n","\n","**Quiz Prompt: Who was the captain of India during the 2011 World Cup win?**\n"," _..
